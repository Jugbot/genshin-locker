### TODO

- Artifact end of list detection
- Artifact card string formatting
- Artifact card lock state
- Tooltips, hovers
- Pause on _any_ keyboard press (+resume??/stop)
- Dropdown
  - Routine lock options read, read&lock, lock
  - Scoring method popularity/rarity with and/or condition
- export data
- 16:9 (1920Ã—1080), 16:10 (1920Ã—1200)
- Install instructions + images
- Adding screen resolutions readme
- GL window icon
- remove this list and publish :)

Stretch:

- fix percentile to be an actual percentile instead of just a score threshold
  - a real percentile would provide the same percent of artifacts from the set of all possible artifacts. Right now outliers heavily affect what is above or below a "percentile".
  - technically the percentile could take rarity into account and be based on the set of _average_ artifacts. needs investigation.
- scrape data from from other languages of lineup simulator
- bg art
- scan other pages
- overlay with keystroke info (e.g. emergency stop)
- find better source for GOOD data
- Pause on bad data, option to skip artifact or skip all, maybe fix on the spot
- Test score percentile creation
- General repo qol: merge hooks for testing etc.
- VJoy?? and gamepad method
- Better Layout component
- Multiple artifact list layouts
- Theme large sizes (e.g. artifact card list)
